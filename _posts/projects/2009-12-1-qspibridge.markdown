description: Qt bindings for AT-SPI accessibility interfaces.

The QSpiBridge library bridges the QAccessible and AT-SPI API's enabling
[Qt](http://qt.nokia.com/products/) applications to be accessible on a
GNOME desktop. This is important to provide parity for users of accessible
technologies. Qt applications are regularly used in Linux and in the past
have not been accessible in either KDE or GNOME.
