description: Interface description language for the D-Bus messaging system.
---

dbuf is an interface description language closely tied to 
[D-Bus](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus). The language has
syntax for describing D-Bus interfaces, messages, errors, and replies. It
can also combine basic D-Bus types in-to compound structures and enums that
can be used in descriptions of the interfaces. I has a modules system and
compiles down to D-Bus introspection XML. The compiler is written in Python,
but uses the [Antlr](http://www.antlr.org/) to describe the syntax and
generate lexers, parsers and output generators.
