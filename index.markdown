Hello, and welcome to my hub. My name is Mark Doffman and I'm a hacker and
developer based in Manchester, UK. I have been working on mobile devices
and platforms for seven years, and open source solutions for the past four. 
The mobile landscape has changed dramatically in that time, unifying devices
with the internet, creating fantastic application platforms, and making the
use of open-source virtually mandatory. I'm keeping up. I'm always on the
lookout for new ideas and exciting technologies.

I have worked on a wide variety of projects in the past, from protocol stacks
to applications. Some of them are showcased on
this site, the rest should be available on
[github](http://github.com/doffm). For my employer,
[Codethink](http://www.codethink.co.uk), I am currently working on the use of
RDF and SPARQL with an open-source mobile platform.

You can find out more by visiting my blog at
